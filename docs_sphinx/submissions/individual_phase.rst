====================

10.1 Draft
---------------------------

- Tsunami Mitigation Strategies
    - simulate and assess the impact of various tsunami mitigation strategies
    - algorithms to model the effectiveness of barriers, early warning systems, and evacuation plans

- Multi-resolution Simulation
    - support multi-resolution grids

    - data structures and algorithms that efficiently handle varying resolutions in different parts
      of the simulation domain.

- Real-time Visualization
    - real-time visualization using C++ graphics libraries like (OpenGL, SFML or SDL)
    - user-friendly interface to visualize the evolving tsunami simulation

- Explore GPU acceleration using NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit
    - simulation algorithms to take advantage of parallel processing on compatible NVIDIA GPUs,
      enhancing the performance
